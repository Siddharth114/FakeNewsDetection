0," Well It Happened, Trump Gets Desperate And Goes Full BENGHAZI On Hillary (TWEET)","It would appear that Donald Trump knows his base of voters don t pay attention to facts and reality, so he s going to keep perpetuating myths and propaganda to anger these people into voting for him even though his claims hold no basis in reality. And in the world of politics and mudslinging, it doesn t much matter as long as your message sticks and you get votes. However, these lies will get debunked, and there s nothing to stop that either.It s become very clear at this point that the presumptive Republican nominee has switched into attack mode against Democratic front-funner Hillary Clinton. If he s not going after her for what her husband did, he s going after her for literally being a woman.Now, knowing how much many conservatives can t wrap their heads around the fact that the Obama administration, including then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, did no wrongdoing in regards to the attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya, he s going to keep pushing the issue anyway. Never mind the fact that there has been probe after probe after probe.Trump tweeted this out to stir the pot, yet again:Hillary has bad judgment! https://t.co/LhcIU6kmxs  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2016Which then leads you to this: Hillary has bad judgment!A video posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on May 10, 2016 at 10:25am PDTLet s be clear on this. There is a very strong likelihood that before all this happened, Trump thought Libya was a female body part, so he s clearly just using this as an attack plan and may not even understand all the details of the event in question. He s a bully though, and being a bully he s going to keep ripping at old scabs even though they re all dried up.When every poll shows Hillary Clinton wiping the floor with Trump among women, minorities and the youth vote, he s got to do something. He s desperate, and this is likely just one of many desperate moves to come out of the Trump campaign.Bringing up Benghazi again after Clinton has been cleared again and again and again. C mon now, Donald. That s just pathetic, and clearly a distraction tactic away from the fact that you are most certainly not prepared to be the leader of the free world.Featured Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"May 10, 2016",False
1,Trump's prediction of 'massive recession' puzzles economists,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s prediction that the U.S. economy was on the verge of a “very massive recession” hit a wall of skepticism on Sunday from economists who questioned the Republican presidential front-runner’s calculations.   In an interview with the Washington Post published on Saturday, the billionaire businessman said a combination of high unemployment and an overvalued stock market had set the stage for another economic slump. He put real unemployment above 20 percent. “We’re not heading for a recession, massive or minor, and the unemployment rate is not 20 percent,” said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York. The official unemployment rate has declined to 5 percent from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009, according to government statistics. But a different, broader measure of unemployment that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment is at 9.8 percent. Coming off a difficult week of campaigning, in which he acknowledged he struggled to articulate his position on abortion among other missteps, Trump’s comments to the Post might be some of his most bearish on the economy and financial markets.  “I think we’re sitting on an economic bubble. A financial bubble,” he said.  Some economists agree the stock market is in a period of overvaluation but do not see that as foretelling a cataclysmic economic downturn originating in the United States. “Nobody can predict what the stock market is going to do,” said Rajeev Dhawan, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University. “I cannot predict a stock market crash, so I cannot predict a recession. I don’t see any of the reasons for a recession going forward unless there is a huge problem with the market or there is some catastrophic world event which is beyond the scope of economics.”  Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo, put the probability of an imminent recession at less than 10 percent. “If it happens, it would be because of what is happening overseas, especially in China and Europe,” he said. Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Pennsylvania, said it would take a “total financial meltdown” to trigger a recession. “We can get by with Europe growing minimally,” he said. “We can get by with China growing modestly because the rest of the U.S. is still solid enough that we can handle weakness in the rest of the world.” The Democratic National Committee criticized Trump for his remarks, saying they “undermine our economy.” Trump’s success with voters, despite his sometimes saying things only to contradict them later, has also alarmed many leading figures within his own party. Some of them are openly plotting to try to prevent him from becoming the nominee at the party’s national convention in July.     Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, said on Sunday that voters were “afraid” of their economic situation, when asked about Trump’s remarks on CNN’s “State of the Union” show. “When people are afraid and when they’re angry, sometimes people say things that they regret,” he said, apparently referring to Trump’s remarks.  He also played down speculation that party leaders would  seek to dislodge Trump by helping someone who is not even a declared candidate prevail at the convention, which becomes governed by complicated voting rules if no candidate arrives with a clear majority. “I think that our candidate is someone who’s running,” Priebus said, referring to Trump, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich. The candidates will next face voters on Tuesday in Wisconsin, where recent polls show Cruz holding a small lead over Trump. ",politicsNews,"April 3, 2016 ",True

3,"Ex-U.S. Attorney Bharara, fired by Trump, joins NYU law school","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, whom President Donald Trump fired earlier this month, will join New York University’s law school on April 1 as a distinguished scholar in residence, the school announced on Tuesday. Bharara said in a statement provided by the school that he was honored to join NYU, and welcomed the opportunity “to continue addressing the issues I so deeply care about - criminal and social justice, honest government, national security, civil rights, and corporate accountability, to name a few.” Bharara will be expected to collaborate with the school’s research centers including those focused on cyber security and criminal law, and to participate in panel discussions and other events, school spokesman Michael Orey said. The position is considered full-time but will not preclude Bharara from taking on other engagements, Orey said. He declined to disclose Bharara’s compensation. Bharara was fired by Trump on March 11 after refusing to step down. He had been among 46 U.S. attorneys who were told a day earlier to submit their resignations. The firing was a surprise because Bharara had told reporters in November that Trump had asked him to remain in the job. As the chief federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan, Bharara oversaw several notable corruption and white-collar criminal cases, as well as other high profile cases involving national security or individuals suspected of links to designated foreign terrorist organizations. A graduate of Harvard University and Columbia Law School, Bharara has been a frequent visitor to NYU, the law school said in the statement. Other people who hold the distinguished scholar in residence position at NYU’s law school include Anne Milgram, former attorney general of New Jersey, and Robert Bauer, a past White House counsel under former President Barack Obama.

4,COINTEL PRO: Are ‘Anti-Fascist’ Media Personalities Playing to the Cameras?,"21st Century Wire says In this age of hyper-politicized mass media, it s becoming harder to differentiate between those who are acting for the cameras, and genuine political protesters. Considering the FBI s own documented history of infiltrating left-wing activists groups in America, is it possible we are witness to some staged performances again?Fox New s Tucker Carlson interviews Yvette Felarca, a self-described middle school teacher  from Berkley and leader of the radical socialist  Anti-Fascist  flash mob mobilization organization known as  By Any Means Necessary  or BAMN. In this interview, Felarca can be seen openly advocating for physical violence against anyone, or any speech, whom she or her activist group deems as a fascist.   Earlier this month, Felarca was one of the media faces of the UC Berkeley unrest which sprung up over an event hosted by gay conservative personality Milo Yiannopoulos. According to Felarca,  Alt-Right  speaker Yiannopoulos should not be allowed to speak in public. Watch her adroit, and intense performance from last night here: Yvette Felarca first gained media exposure after previously leading an alleged counter-protest against a  Fascist Rally  at what was branded by the mainstream media as the  Battle of Sacramento  in July 2016.  On its face, this protest looked very much a staged media event, perfectly scheduled ahead of time, and with activist actor Felarca playing the part of agent provocateur for the cameras. At the Sacramento event, supposed protesters on both sides were holding what appeared to be light weight wooden props, apparently meant to be fighting sticks. Felarca s leftist group were wearing face masks and balaclavas to conceal their identities, another strong indication that these are not real protesters, and could very well be  activist  actors playing for the cameras. What is perhaps the biggest give-away of the staged performance was the fact that the scores of police who were on site just stood back while what appeared to be violence and heavy fighting broke out, allowing it to carry on for quite some time   which means that either they were not actually policing but supervising, or they were there as part of the backdrop for the media. It was a bizarre scene to say the least. Certainly, FBI programs like COINTELPRO which began in 1956, come to mind here.Watch the following montage of this media event: Watch what appears to be a well rehearsed, albeit overly dramatic, and borderline sociopathic TV performance here:  Despite the comparatively small size of both the CP and the American SWP by the late 1950s and early 1960s, their members  implantation in industrial workplaces, independent electoral campaigns, desegregation, and antiwar activities, as well as the bureau s fanatical obsession with  communism,  made them targets. New Left activists who were not only hampering the ability of the U.S. to fight in Vietnam, but also challenging ideological assumptions about women s roles, sexuality, and segregation garnered attention and harassment by the state as well. But the most disruptive and violent COINTELPRO operations in the period from the late 1960s into the mid-1970s were directed against the Black and Native American struggles.It was a general rule throughout the 1960s, that local police departments would devote at least 1 percent of their resources to surveillance and infiltration.13 These local agents, acting in cahoots with the feds, read the left-wing press and became familiar with the fact that organized leftists were involved in liberal and pacifist groups and that individuals were often radicalized by these ideas as well as by their own experiences of struggle. Media Lightning Rods  As far as the FBI are concerned, traditionally their justification for managing  radical  rightwing persons as is with the FBI s PATCON program, or leftwing personalities as confidential informants as with the Weather Underground and other groups   has always been that these colorful personalities were effective in attracting or recruiting  the worst of the worst  and therefore by attracting the most radical activists, the FBI would then be able to ensnare them in a sting operation in order to root out what the agency sees as potential threats by  taking this dangerous person off the street  or to  avert a future domestic terrorist incident.  This is also the same rationale applied to the use of informants to stir-up radical activity in Islamic mosques, and to entrap and convict  future terrorists  in the US.Certainly, Felarca plays a very unique dual protagonist-antagonist role in this very public political drama   as a recruitment tool for the radical left into her political front organization, but also as a media object of scorn for the Alt Right and for conservative media outlets like FOX and others. Hers is an active role in increasing political tension and polarization in the US. In this tenuous post-election environment, her scathing rhetoric  calls for violence will appeal the most extreme leftwing activists, while simultaneously giving some media (mainstream cultural) legitimacy to the most radical elements of the extreme left.Here agitator Felarca is allowed to start a physical fight which led to men kicking someone on the ground, and then police seem to recognize her before allowing her to leave the scene quietly: READ MORE COINTELPRO AT: 21st Century Wire COINTELPRO Files",Middle-east,"February 15, 2017",False

8,Illinois lawmaker's daughter charged in political staple attack,"(Reuters) - A daughter of an Illinois state representative has been charged with participating in an attack on one of her mother’s  political rivals that included using a staple gun on the victim’s forehead, police and the victim said on Friday. Jessica Soto and Bradley Fichter, both 26 and of Chicago, have been charged with three counts of aggravated battery in a March 6 attack on Robert Zwolinski, who was defeated in a primary this month by Soto’s mother, state Representative Cynthia Soto, Chicago police said.  Lawyers for the two were not immediately available for comment. The attack took place outside of Zwolinski’s campaign office. Frank Avila, a lawyer for the couple, told local media that  Zwolinski started the fight and possibly put a stable in his own head for attention. Avila identified Soto as the daughter of Representative Soto and denied the daughter was part of the attack.  Police said Zwolinski was hit with a metal object and glass bottle. Zwolinski said the metal object was the staple gun and he had his forehead repeatedly stapled by the pair. The night of the fight, Zwolinski posted photos on social media of a staple sticking out of his forehead, a bloodied face, and a swollen nose. “The girl was yelling, while I was on the ground fighting the man off of me, ‘This is Soto’s territory! This isn’t your territory,’” Zwolinski said.  Representative Soto could not immediately be reached. ",politicsNews,"March 18, 2016 ",True

10,Gunmen kill four  in sectarian attack in Pakistan,"QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Gunmen in southwestern Pakistan killed four members of a Shi ite Muslim Hazara family, including a 12-year-old boy, on Sunday, in the latest sectarian attack on the minority community, a senior police official said.  Two men on a motorcycle opened fire on a family of eight while they at a filling station some 30 kilometres (19 miles) north of Quetta, the capital of Pakistan s Baluchistan province. Aside from those killed, two others were wounded. Two  female members of the family were unscathed, having remained in their vehicle.  This was a sectarian attack,  senior police officer Tanveer Shah told Reuters, adding that no group has claimed responsibility for the shooting. Hazaras are frequently targeted by Taliban and Islamic State militants, and other Sunni Muslim militant groups in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.  Many Hazaras fled to Pakistan during decades of conflict in neighboring Afghanistan, and nearly half a million now live in and around Quetta. In 2013, three separate bombings killed over 200 people in Hazara neighborhoods, raising international awareness of the plight of the community. More than 20 Hazaras have been killed in similar shootings in Baluchistan in the past two years, police say.  The ongoing violence in the province has fueled concern about security for projects in the $57-billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a transport and energy link planned to run from western China to Pakistan s southern deep-water port of Gwadar.

12, WATCH: Samantha Bee Skewers Evangelicals For Obsessing Over Abortion,"Full Frontal host Samantha Bee returned on Monday to continue mocking evangelical conservative  Christians  and their sordid history.This time, Bee focused on the  Moral Majority s  obsession with abortion and controlling women s bodies.When the show kicked off, Bee introduced the next part of her examination of the history of the evangelical movement. Last week, we took a look at the religious right   those coveted evangelical voters that conservatives spent decades pandering to only to be dumped just before November prom for a heretical billionaire bully who only says the word  God  when he is ejaculating on a pile of money,  Bee said.Bee then explained how evangelicals were not obsessed with abortion when the Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that a woman s right to choose an abortion is protected by the Constitution in the landmark Roe v. Wade case in 1973 because the decision was supported by the Southern Baptist Convention at the time. It wasn t until later on that conservatives decided to politicize the issue.Bee went on to introduce one of the founders of the  pro-life  movement.Filmmaker Frank Schaeffer not only admitted to helping found the movement, he said he regrets it. One of the things that I did back in the day when I was young was help found, start, begin what became known as the  pro-life movement,  Schaeffer said.  It is the single greatest regret of my life. We made a film series called  Whatever Happened to the Human Race  featuring my dad   Francis Schaeffer   and Dr. C. Everett Coop. Bee then played part of the series, which looks like a horror film. Another clip featured a Schoolhouse Rock vibe but the cartoon was equally horrible.According to Schaeffer: Most evangelical leaders didn t want anything to do with it. They wanted to just preach Jesus. They thought politics was dirty. They didn t want anything to do with it. We had to talk them into it. And so, evangelicals began their hostile takeover of the Republican Party and proceeded to prove their  pro-life  credentials by committing 185 arsons, 42 bombings, 100 acid attacks, 26 attempted murders, and 11 murders against clinics between 1977 and 2015.Bee even noted where Republicans got the idea for their war on women by showing a Little Rascals short featuring Spanky founding the He-Man Woman Haters Club. Spanky then raises his arms and Bee stops the clip and shows an image of Trump raising his arms the same way.Then Bee put on the finishing touches by showing video of one of the thousands of annoying anti-abortion nuts screaming outside of a clinic about how the Bible is against abortion. Fine,  Bee said.  Let s look at everything the Bible says about abortion. Oh, look! There it is in the book of doesn t exist. Here s the video via YouTube.Samantha Bee should continue this series on the history of the religious right because she is doing a fantastic job of shining a light on them.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"May 24, 2016",False
13, Bernie Criticizes Israel’s ‘Disproportionate’ 2014 Slaughter Of Palestinian Civilians (VIDEO),"Bernie Sanders mildly criticized Israel s actions during the 2014 massacre of over 1400 Palestinian civilians by describing it as  disproportionate.  I m going to stress the word  mild  here because it will be held up as an extreme attack on Israel because that s where our political system is today. Any politician that even slightly disagrees with Israel s tendency to shoot first, ask questions never is labeled as the next coming of Hitler by the rabidly pro-Israel right and the slightly less rabid pro-Israel left. A fact that did not escape CNN s Jake Tapper:Tapper then inquired why Sanders, who like many American Jews identifies as Jewish but says he s  not very religious,  was taking a  critical  position on Israel. It is interesting that the first Jew in American history to win a delegate, much less a primary, is taking a position on Israel that is Usually in American politics everyone just supports Israel and whatever Israel wants to do. You re taking a more critical position,  Tapper said.It s rare for anyone, much less a journalist, to put it so bluntly so kudos to Tapper as well. Bernie, not one to shy away from controversy, gave a perfectly reasonable response that will in no way mollify his pro-war critics: A more balanced position,  Sanders interrupted.  Whether Jewish or not Jewish, I would hope that every person in this country wants to see the misery of never-ending war and conflict ending in the Middle East. It s a difficult issue. Other people have tried to deal with it for years. All that I m saying  as somebody who is absolutely pro-Israeli, absolutely 100 percent supports Israel s right to exist in peace and in security  I think that the only way we succeed is of course the United States supports Israel, but you cannot ignore the needs of the Palestinian people. You can t just be concerned about Israel s needs. You have to be concerned about the needs of all the people in the region,  Sanders added.Ohhhhhh .he s going to pay for that. One of the basic tenets of the pro-Israeli worldview is the Palestinians are not real people. They re all  terrorists  and  terrorist sympathizers,  even the small children. Keeping them deprived of food, medicine and other basic human needs is only natural since they re little better than animals. If you think I m exaggerating, you must not have spoken to many strident Israel supporters or listened to how the Israeli government and people talk about a Final Solution to the Palestinian Problem.Here s Bernie completely crazed, anti-Semitic (but not really) rant:Featured image via screen cap.",News,"April 10, 2016",False
14,Obama budget to adjust health insurance 'Cadillac tax': adviser,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will propose tailoring the controversial “Cadillac tax” on expensive private health insurance plans to reflect regional differences when he releases his 2017 budget plan next week, a senior White House adviser said in an article released on Wednesday. Obama's proposal would reduce the bite of the unpopular tax by raising the threshold where it takes effect in areas where healthcare is particularly expensive, according to the article in the New England Journal of Medicine co-written by Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. (bit.ly/1QdGlDG) The tax on high-cost employer-based healthcare plans, passed as part of the president’s 2010 Affordable Care Act and set to take effect in 2018, has generated growing opposition in part because labor unions say it could encourage employers to cut back on health insurance plans for workers. The tax was expected to raise some $87 billion a year to help pay for the reform generally known as Obamacare.   White House officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

15,"Clinton calls Trump a 'loose cannon,' risky choice for president","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton took quick aim at presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday, saying the United States should not take a risk on an unreliable candidate. “He is a loose cannon, and loose cannons tend to misfire,” Clinton said in an interview with CNN, citing Trump stances including an allegation that climate change was a Chinese hoax.  Clinton, a former secretary of state, said Trump would have to offer policy specifics in ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election and criticized him for his positions on issues including nuclear weapons and abortion. “He makes these grand statements and grand accusations,” Clinton said of the real estate magnate and former reality TV star. “At some point when you’re running for president, you actually have to put a little meat on the bones. You’ve got to tell people what it is you’re going to do and how you’re going to do it.” Clinton lost the Democratic primary contest in Indiana on Tuesday but still looks set to win her party’s nomination, leading her rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, by more than 800 delegates. Trump’s win in Indiana on Tuesday pushed his rivals out of the race and left him as the presumptive nominee. In a preview of the likely general election battle, Clinton laughed when asked if she was ready to take on Trump, saying: “Oh, please.” “This is to me a classic case of a blustering, bullying guy who has knocked out of the way all the Republicans because they were just dumbfounded,” she said. Clinton said she knew how to run a campaign against Trump and took a swipe at Trump’s 16 Republican presidential rivals who started out in the 2016 campaign. “They didn’t know how to deal with him,” Clinton said. “They couldn’t take him on the issues because they basically agreed with them. And they didn’t know how to counterpunch.” Asked how “scorched-earth” the campaign was likely to be, she replied: “You know, he’s the one making that decision. ... He’s the one who’s run the campaign insulting people, demeaning women, degrading people with disabilities, talking about keeping Muslims out of the country, he’s the one that’s been running that kind of very negative, aggressive, bullying campaign. “I’m going to keep staying on the kind of campaign I’m running,” she said.

16,(VIDEO) WATCH GOV RICK PERRY SQUIRM AS TRUMP TRAVELS TO TEXAS BORDER TOMORROW,"However you feel about Trump as a candidate for President, he s done more in the past few weeks than most candidates have ever done. The most important think he s done is call attention to our open border with Mexico. It s about time someone REALLY acted on this. It s interesting to watch Rick Perry squirm when talking about the border. If you haven t seen one of the most revealing political videos to expose all talk and no action then the video below is EXHIBIT 1: There are a few select moments in broadcast TV when the production content highlights a very distinct reality   and simultaneously informs the viewership on the absurd construct of political dynamics. Last night Sean Hannity did just that.Former Texas Governor Rick Perry has been blasting 2016 GOP candidate Donald Trump over Trump s remarks about illegal alien criminals. Perry s criticism has aided the liberal media s efforts to isolate, ridicule and marginalize Trump.However, using Rick Perry s own Texas border reality, and showing the criminal statistics inherent from Perry s own team, Hannity shows how Donald Trump is right, and Perry is just playing politics. It was one of the best constructed segments Hannity has ever broadcast.The segment begins at 03:35 and runs through 08:12. The most substantial moment comes at 05:35. Watch: DONALD TRUMP WILL VISIT THE BORDER BETWEEN TEXAS AND MEXICO ON THURSDAY:The presidential candidate will arrive in Laredo to meet with a local border patrol union before traveling to the border to address the media. He ll then speak at an event for law enforcement, his campaign said.Trump s camp said representatives from the Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Laredo Police Department, the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will be invited to the second event. The business mogul has soared to the top of the polls as he s called for tougher immigration policies. Many of his comments have unnerved national GOP figures   including remarks from his campaign launch that America is becoming Mexico s  dumping ground  and that many Mexicans who cross into America illegally are criminals or  rapists.

18,Republican candidate Kasich's 'kitchen' comment draws scorn,"(Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John Kasich drew scorn on Monday after a video emerged in which he told a crowd that early in his career, he gleaned support from women who “left their kitchens” to campaign.  The comments were made in reference to his 1978 run for Ohio’s state Senate, according to a spokesman, and not his current presidential campaign, in which he is running fifth nationally for the Republican nomination, Reuters-Ipsos polling shows.  “We just got an army of people who, and many women, who left their kitchens to go out and go door-to-door and to put yard signs up,” Kasich says in footage of Monday’s event in Virginia.  Kasich, 63, added his first campaign took place in an era in which “things were different.”  “Now you call homes and everybody’s out working,” Kasich said.  He apologized for the remark later on Monday.  “Of course, I’m more than happy to say I’m sorry if I offended somebody out there but it wasn’t intended to be offensive and if you hear the whole thing, you’ll understand the context of it,” Kasich told CNN.  In the video, an unseen audience member seems to criticize the Ohio governor for his comment.  “I want to say, your comment earlier, about the women came out of the kitchen to support you: I’ll come to support you but I won’t be coming out of the kitchen.”  The response on social media was swift and negative, with many Twitter (TWTR.N) users decrying Kasich’s anecdote as sexist.  “It’s 2016. A woman’s place is...wherever she wants it to be,” wrote Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) on Monday, in a quotation retweet that refers to Kasich’s comments about his first campaign.  Kasich press secretary Rob Nichols told Reuters the governor’s political campaigns “have always been homegrown affairs.”  “Many of his early campaign teams were made up of stay-at-home moms who believed deeply in the changes he wanted to bring,” Nichols said. “He’s proud of that authentic support. To try and twist his comments into anything else is just desperate politics.”  Some social media users compared Kasich’s comment to former Republican candidate Mitt Romney’s “binders full of women” moment from the 2012 presidential campaign, when he described receiving many resumes from women. The comment struck many at the time as tone deaf.  “Mitt had binders full of women, and Kasich has kitchens full of women,” tweeted Chicago Jesus (@Patriot_Musket).     (Reporting by Amy Tennery in New York; Additional reporting by Eric Beech in Washington; Editing by Andrew Hay and Peter Cooney)  This article was funded in part by SAP.

19,"Turkey suggests plan to extend military mission in Syria to Afrin, Aleppo","ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey said on Tuesday it could expand its military mission in Syria to two other provinces, potentially bringing its forces into confrontation with U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters that Ankara considers its enemies. Turkish troops have operated an  observation mission  in rebel-held territory in Syria s northwestern Idlib province, under a deal with Damascus allies Russia and Iran to help reduce fighting between insurgents and government forces.  It s been considered that the observation mission of the Turkish armed forces in the Idlib de-escalation zone is continuing successfully, and such a mission being performed near Western Aleppo and Afrin would provide a real environment of peace and safety,  Turkey s National Security Council said in a statement. Ankara, which has long backed rebels fighting to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad, has toned down its demands that Assad leave power. It now says its main concerns in Syria are combating both Islamist militants and Kurdish fighters it considers allies of the Kurdistan Workers  Party (PKK) which has fought a decades-long insurgency in southeastern Turkey. Earlier this month, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said that Turkey needed to clear the Afrin region of northwest Syria of Kurdish YPG militia fighters as the military operation in Idlib province is largely complete. The Kurdish YPG is the main element in a U.S.-backed force that Washington has assisted with training, weapons, air support and help from ground advisers in the battle against Islamic State. Washington s support for the YPG is a bone of contention between the United States and Turkey, which are allies in NATO. ",worldnews,"November 28, 2017 ",True
